                    <P>Proteins are essential for the body's structure, function, and regulation. They serve as enzymes, accelerating biochemical reactions, and act as antibodies, bolstering the immune system. Proteins are vital for muscle contraction, cell signaling, and hormone regulation, supporting overall health and well-being. Adequate protein intake is crucial to maintain healthy tissues, organs, and overall body function.
